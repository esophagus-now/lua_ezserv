      This project is designed to be the easiest/friendliest
      way to add HTTP and websocket server support to a Lua
      project. It uses boost beast behind the scenes.

      Features:
      - Asynchronous
      - Friendly API: just eight functions, yet supports
        all kinds of usage patters in Lua (event polling,
        coroutines, etc.)
      - HTTP requests are parsed for you, and you can
        send back data or error codes
      - Can upgrade HTTP sessions to websockets and
        send/receive data. The websocket framing, security,
        pings/pongs, etc. are all handled by boost beast.

     This is not meant to be a high-performance 10000 thread
     webserver. It is meant to be an easy way to add web support
     to small projects.
